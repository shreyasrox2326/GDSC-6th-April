sierp.py
plots the sierpinsky triangle using the chaos game algorithm, each point is 1 pixel.

sierp-anim.py
same thing but animated, to show how it works

orbital.py
plots the 3P orbital of a hydrogen atom and displays it

the rpg here is that you are a 19th century physicist and mathematician and you are watching a computer plot your equation for an orbital / implement game theory

you might need to install mapplotlib if not already installed

just open it in vs code and run it. it should work.
