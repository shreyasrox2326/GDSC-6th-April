sierp.py
plots the sierpinsky triangle using the chaos game algorithm, each point is 1 pixel.

sierp-anim.py
same thing but animated, to show how it works, requires user input which can be 1 or 2

1 plots large number of points each point is 1 pixel.
2 plots lesser points but each point is larger.

orbital.py
plots the 3P orbital of a hydrogen atom and displays it.
requires user input 1,2,3,4,or 5.
higher input = higher resolution (doubled)

the rpg here is that you are a 19th century physicist and mathematician and you are watching a computer plot your equation for an orbital / implement game theory

you might need to install mapplotlib if not already installed

just open it in vs code and run it. it should work.
